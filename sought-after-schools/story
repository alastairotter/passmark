Gauteng’s most sought-after schools
We all want our children to go to good schools, right? And, let’s face it, some schools are way better than others.
Who wants to send their seven-year-old to a school with broken toilets and no sports fields? 

And when it comes to high schools, we want our teenagers to get the best chance of passing Grade 12 in a school
that has properly stocked science labs, computers and class sizes small enough for teachers to handle.

But what if you can’t get your child into the school you want? 

On November 1, when Gauteng’s online registration system opened for late applications for grades 1 and 8 for
the 2018 school year, I took a look to see which public school options were available for my youngest, who’s
starting high school in 2018. Not one of the four high schools near to where I live, and to which I’d choose
to send my child, had places available. 

In fact, by November, 402 schools had “received applications beyond their capacity” and were not available for
late applications, Panyaza Lesufi, the head of Gauteng’s Education Department (GDE), said in a media statement
when the online registration system opened again for late applications.

The GDE posted a PowerPoint document entitled "High pressure areas and schools. Schools that are not available for late applications" [http://www.education.gpg.gov.za/Documents/Schools%20that%20are%20not%20available%20for%20late%20applications.pptx] on its website.

There were 457 schools on the list, but three of the schools were listed twice, and there were a couple of
mistakes in the numbering so altogether there were 451 not-available schools on the list – 248 primary schools,
201 high schools and two “combined schools”. You can see where all the full schools are in an interactive
map at the end of this story.

The most striking thing about the department’s list of “full schools” is how a small number of high schools seem
to have received a huge number of applications for grade 8. 

According to Lesufi, by 1 November, 98,928 of next year’s grade 8s had been placed in a school. Incredibly, 40,292
applications – 40% of the number that have been placed – were submitted to just 34 high schools. 

Each of those high schools received more than 1,000 applications for grade 8. The combined capacity of those
34 schools was just over 8,300, according to the GDE. So more than 20,000 parents who applied to one of those
schools at the beginning of this year would have been turned down and their child offered a place in another
school. 

There are 616 high schools listed on Gauteng’s latest available [http://www.education.gpg.gov.za/Schools/Documents/Public%20Schools%202017-05-10.xls]masterlist, so those 34 really popular schools are just 5% of the high schools. 

What’s also interesting is that all these schools, except for one, are fee-paying schools. Phumlani Secondary
in Katlehong is the only school that isn’t a former Model C school and it’s the only one that’s a no-fee
school. 

These are the 34 Gauteng high schools that got more than 1,000 applications for grade 8:

 Popular primary schools

In contrast to the high schools, only three primary schools got more than 1,000 applications each for grade 1 by November: Laerskool Akasia, Laerskool Theresapark and Bryanston Primary School.

These are the 20 Gauteng primary schools that had received the most applications for grade 1 by November 2017:

According to Lesufi, 123,450 grade ones and 98,928 grade eights had been placed in a school by November. But
that’s only 77% of the 285,834 learners who applied before November. That means more than 60,000 learners who had applied early had yet to be placed in a school.

There’s a lesson in this for parents: if you want to get your child into the school of your choice, apply early.
