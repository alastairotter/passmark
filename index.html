                <p>Data is key to understanding the state of education in South Africa but the data that is available often
                    isn’t easy to access or make sense of. Passmark’s aim is to create a clearer picture of the state of
                    our schools by collecting the data that’s out there and presenting it in ways that make it useful to
                    parents, pupils, educators and anybody else who has an interest in education.</p>
                <p>We believe that quality data leads to deeper insight, so we will also make the data we collect available
                    for others to use.</p>

                <p>On 29 November 2013 the Regulations Relating to Minimum Uniform Norms and Standards for Public School Infrastructure
                    were signed by the minister of education. These standards define what a public school should look like.
                    They include what a school should be made of, what basic services it should have, the maximum number
                    of learners in a class, what sports facilities, laboratories, and security it should have. The regulations
                    also set deadlines for achieving these standards.</p>

                <p>The first deadline was 29 November 2016.</p>

                    <p>One of the things President Cyril Ramaphosa listed as an achievement in his 2018 State of the Nation address was that “at least 187” ASIDI schools have been completed by the Department of Basic Education.</p>
    
    <p>The Accelerated Schools Infrastructure Development Iniative (ASIDI) was launched in 2011 with the aim of bringing basic services to schools that had no access to water, sanitation and electricity and to replace schools made of mud, wood and asbestos. An R8.2-billion grant, known as the Schools Infrastructure Backlog Grant (SIBG), was allocated to fund the work. </p>
    <p>Passmark got a list of 187 new schools that have been built through the ASIDI programme and made an interactive tool to view the completed schools. </p>

                        President Cyril Ramaphosa dedicated a substantial chunk of his first State of the Nation Address in Parliament on February 16 2018, to persuading South Africans to put “the era of discord, disunity and disillusionment” behind them. “A new dawn is upon us,” he said.</p>
        
        <p>
          What does that mean? Working on the assumption that the number of words the president devotes to a topic is an indication of the level of importance he places on that topic, Passmark looked at the past six State of the Nation addresses and visualised the 12 topics that got the most airtime. Education, we are happy to report, has been in the top 12 in all but one year, 2016, which was, ironically, just after the #FeesMustFall protests started on campuses around the country.</p>

                <p>South Africa has more than 25,000 schools, 23,000 of which are public schools that cater for more than 12-million
                    learners. In theory, that means on average there is one school for every 500 learners. But, in reality,
                    that isn’t the case. Some schools cater to just a handful of learners while others have thousands of
                    children.

                    <span style="font-weight: 700;">Passmark</span> used the schools masterlist for the first quarter of 2016, the latest data available
                    from the Department of Basic Education, to look at how big South Africa’s schools are.</p>

                        education has barely made an appearance. In the 2017 SONA, education featured more prominently, mostly
                        because of the Fees Must Fall protests. Passmark looked at the all ten SONAs and the issues that featured

                <div class="headline">Hidden danger: asbestos in Gauteng's schools</div>

                <p>South Africa's Department of Education adopted regulations in 2013 stipulating that all schools made of asbestos
                    had to be replaced by 29 November 2016. The Gauteng education department (GDE), which is responsible
                    for the province’s school infrastructure, identified 29 asbestos schools for replacement, but not one
                    of them was replaced by the deadline.</p>

                <p>What’s more, the 29 schools currently earmarked for replacement are just a small part of the problem. According
                    to the GDE’s own information, there are more than 200 schools in the province with asbestos structures.
                    But the list of asbestos schools keeps changing, and it is unclear if it is complete, and if the asbestos
                    structures are in good condition.</p>

                <p>Asbestos was banned in South Africa in 2008 because it is known to cause cancer.</p>
