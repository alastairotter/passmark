                A new dawn, or more of the same? A comparison of Cyril Ramphosa’s speech with Jacob Zuma’s

        <div class="intro">
                <p>President Cyril Ramaphosa dedicated a substantial chunk of his first State of the Nation Address in Parliament
                        on February 16 2018, to persuading South Africans to put “the era of discord, disunity and disillusionment”
                        behind them. “A new dawn is upon us,” he said.</p>

                <p>What does that mean? Working on the assumption that the number of words the president devotes to a topic is an indication of the level of importance he places on that topic, Passmark looked at the past six State of the Nation addresses and visualised the 12 topics that got the most airtime. Education, we are happy to report, has been in the top 12 in all but one year, 2016, which was, ironically, just after the #FeesMustFall protests started on campuses around the country.</p>

                <p class="crosshead">Do the comparison</p>

                <p>We also compared Cyril Ramaphosa's top 12 topics with the number of words Jacob Zuma dedicated to those same topics in his SONA speeches. To see that comparison, click the 'compare' button below.</p>

                                                Not surprisingly, given the recent credit rating downgrades, and years of slow growth, the economy features strongly, along
                                                with jobs and unemployment, particularly youth unemployment. Social cohesion/nation
                                                building was right up there too because the new president has to win back
                                                the trust of a disillusioned electorate bruised by a constant barrage of
                                                “state capture” headlines, which also explains why corruption was one of
                                                the top-five topics. We ranked education at number five, with the free higher

                                                into effect this year, dominating the topic. The president also said the

                                                schools will be completed by the end of the next financial year.

                                                which ranked 17th on our word-count scale, all of it on cost of higher education.

                                                Besides the state of the economy, violent protests featured prominently. “The dominant narrative in the case of the protests
                                                in South Africa has been to attribute them to alleged failures of government.
                                                However the protests are not simply the result of ‘failures’ of government
                                                but also of the success in delivering basic services,” the president told
                                                the nation. Education was ranked fourth: it was a celebration of the government’s
                                                achievements in increasing the number of children enrolled in schools, particularly
                                                no-fee schools, as well as the school nutrition programme.
